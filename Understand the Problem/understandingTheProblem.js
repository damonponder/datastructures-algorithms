/*

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

3. What are the outputs that should come 
from the solution to the problem?

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
In other words, do I have enough information
to solve the problem? (You may not be able to 
    answer this question until you set about
    solving the problem. That is OK; its still
    worth considering the question at this early
    stage.)

5. How should I label the important pieces of data
that are a part of the problem?
