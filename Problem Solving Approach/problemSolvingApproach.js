Define what an Algorithm is -

- A process or set of steps to accomplish a
    certain task

    - Why do you need to know this?
        - Almost everything that you do in 
        programming involves some kind of
        algorithm
    -  It's  the foundation of being a
    successful problem solver and developer

Devise a plan to solve Algorithms

- HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?

    - Devise a plan for solving problems

    - Master common problem solving patterns

    - PROBLEM SOLVING

        - Understand the problem
        -Explore concrete Examples
        -Break it Down
        -Solve/Simplify
        -Look Back and Refactor

Compare and Contrast problem solving patterns
including frequency counters, two pointer
problems and divide and conquer
